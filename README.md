# Timer
A game made for the 2016 High School TSA Video Game Design Competition

Timer is a side scrolling platformer set in a dystopian future. You play as an agent who has just stolen a megacorporation's experimental time reversal device and must escape through five levels of a facility to win.

This game was developed from scratch with SFML and C++. It took almost the whole school year and the code isn't very well written, but it was my first big game project and I learned a ton from the process.
